ðŸ“Š Step-by-Step Workflow:
1. Data Collection
Download lane detection datasets (images or videos).

Annotated image frames with lane markings.

2. Data Preprocessing
Resize images

Convert to grayscale

Apply Gaussian Blur

Use Canny Edge Detector

Define a Region of Interest (ROI) mask

3. Classical Lane Detection Approach (Optional)
Hough Line Transform

Curve fitting for lanes (polynomial)

4. Deep Learning-based Lane Detection
Use semantic segmentation models like:

U-Net

SegNet

ENet

Train the model to segment lane pixels.

Loss function: Dice Loss or Binary Cross Entropy

5. Model Evaluation
Metrics: IoU (Intersection over Union), Precision, Recall

Visual evaluation using overlayed prediction masks

6. Post-processing
Map segmented lines back to original perspective

Draw lane overlay on the original frame

7. Real-time Inference
Use OpenCV to process live video or webcam feed

Detect and display lane overlays in real-time

8. Deployment (Optional)
Build a simple GUI using:

Streamlit (for a dashboard)

Flask (for a lightweight web app)

Allow user to upload a video and detect lanes

ðŸ“Œ Bonus Features (Advanced):
Lane curvature detection

Detect departure from lane (LDWS)

Handle rain/night conditions with data augmentation

YOLO-based vehicle detection + lane detection (multi-task)
